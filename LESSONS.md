# Lessons Learned

Use this file to record practical lessons that would save future contributors or
agents meaningful time. Keep entries factual, concise, and tied to prevention.

## Canonical Docs Define Scope Before Structure

- Context: Initiating the spec-driven-development baseline for an early research
  and design repository.
- Symptom: It would be easy to invent implementation, CI, scenario, or release
  conventions before the roadmap calls for them.
- Cause: The repository already has canonical proposal, roadmap, design
  principles, and harness documents that define durable boundaries and phase
  order.
- Resolution: Root SDD documents were initiated as lightweight indexes and
  boundary records, not as detailed process or architecture commitments.
- Prevention: Before major changes, read `README.md`, `docs/proposal.md`,
  `docs/roadmap.md`, `docs/design_principles.md`, and
  `docs/harness/health-policy-strategy-game/team-spec.md`; document deferred
  conventions instead of filling them in prematurely.

## First Engine Proof Should Stay Scripted

- Context: Replacing the placeholder CLI with the first deterministic
  architecture proof.
- Symptom: It is tempting to add scenario loading, interactive menus, richer
  actor frameworks, or hash libraries immediately.
- Cause: The roadmap asks for vertical slices before broad frameworks, and the
  codebase had no existing architecture to constrain abstractions.
- Resolution: The first proof uses one scripted command, explicit resolved
  inputs, simple integer metrics, deterministic replay, and no dependencies.
- Prevention: Add loaders, modules, dependencies, and broader actor frameworks
  only when a later slice has at least two concrete examples that need the same
  boundary.

## Second Slice Can Still Stay Single-File

- Context: Adding the first state-policy response after the initial
  payer-negotiation proof.
- Symptom: A second command and second actor decision can make a module split
  feel immediately attractive.
- Cause: The design boundary is now visible, but the prototype still has one
  compact transition function and no reusable scenario, CLI, or persistence
  boundary.
- Resolution: The policy response reused the existing command, observation,
  event, effect, history, and replay shapes without adding dependencies or
  modules.
- Prevention: Split modules when reuse or independent testing needs become
  concrete, not merely because a second branch exists in the demo.

## Debriefing Can Start From Committed History

- Context: Adding the first educational debrief to the deterministic demo.
- Symptom: It is tempting to design a general reporting framework, scenario
  schema, or instructor export format before the first debrief exists.
- Cause: The existing transition history already contains observations, actor
  rationales, attributed effects, and final state needed for a useful teaching
  summary.
- Resolution: The first debrief is a deterministic report over committed
  history, with no new dependency, loader, or persistent artifact format.
- Prevention: Add reporting structure only when repeated debrief outputs need a
  shared format or external consumers.

## First Playability Step Can Be Hard-Coded

- Context: Adding the first player-facing CLI choice after the scripted
  deterministic demo and debrief were working.
- Symptom: It is tempting to add a command parser, scenario schema, or save/load
  path as soon as stdin appears.
- Cause: The immediate roadmap need is to test whether different strategic
  paths produce understandable outcomes, not to define durable content formats.
- Resolution: The first playable slice uses three compiled strategy paths and a
  small input boundary that selects among existing deterministic transitions.
- Prevention: Add parsers and scenario loaders only when repeated playable
  content needs external authoring or persistence.
