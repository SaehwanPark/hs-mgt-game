# Final Handoff — Visual/audio Phase 11.1 live operational overlays v0.12.90

## Result

The current live `competitive-regional-world-v1` projection now binds directly
visible operational conditions to the existing operational-overlay catalog.
Raw demand/access/capacity metrics remain raw metrics; unknown explicit IDs use
the generic overlay fallback.

## Changed files and behavior

- Added optional `operational_overlay_id` projection metadata and deterministic
  condition bindings in `src/mcp/regional_world.rs`.
- Resolved explicit catalog IDs and exposed source, written-equivalent,
  non-color, and DOM accessibility metadata in `gui/regional-board.mjs` and
  `gui/app.mjs`.
- Added Rust and Node/Python focused coverage for visible condition bindings,
  absent conditions, raw metric preservation, fallback, and no-authority rules.
- Updated the Phase 11.1 ledger/evidence, canonical project records, lessons,
  generated credits version projections, and v0.12.90 release notes.

## Verification

- `cargo test` — 329 passed; `cargo fmt --check`; Clippy with warnings denied.
- Python discovery — 546 passed, including the new live operational-overlay
  test.
- Release metadata, documentation links, asset registry/credits/release, and
  visual/audio contract audit checks passed.

## Handoff and review

- Base: `main` at v0.12.89.
- Working branch: `feat/visual-audio-phase11-live-overlays-v0.12.90`.
- Presentation-domain QA: pass for the bounded contract; evidence limits are
  recorded in `_workspace/03_presentation_qa.md`.
- One code-reviewer skill is reserved for the required review passes; no other
  reviewer will be used.

## Limits and next slice

Full Phase 11.1 facility/overlay/event/history/debrief/save-load/replay
continuity, screenshots, performance, compatibility, asset quality, human
evaluation, and later Phase 11.2–13 gates remain open. Remaining overlay
categories require later host-committed visible sources and must not be inferred
from arbitrary metrics.

# Historical Final Handoff — Visual/audio Phase 6.1 motion specification v0.12.68

## Result

Phase 6.1 is complete. Nine visible motion categories now have explicit
semantic purpose, timing, easing, reduced-motion, interruption, replay-order,
input, simultaneous-load, and declared performance-budget contracts.

## Changed files and behavior

- Added `gui/motion-catalog.mjs` with pure catalog, deterministic replay plan,
  interruption result, and simultaneous-load report.
- Added `gui/motion-proof.html` with reduced-motion, interruption, replay order,
  responsive, print, and local budget smoke proof; it starts no timers or
  animations.
- Added focused tests, registry/credits provenance, roadmap completion, and
  v0.12.68 SPEC/ARCHITECTURE/CHANGELOG/history/lessons records.
- No runtime animation, host sequencing, command, simulation, stochastic,
  history, hash, replay-authority, audio, or debrief behavior changed.

## Verification

- Focused motion-catalog tests — 4 passed; full Python discovery — 454 passed.
- `cargo fmt -- --check` passed; serial `cargo test -- --test-threads=1`
  passed with 328 Rust unit tests plus 13 integration/golden/scenario tests.
- Release metadata, 343 Markdown documentation links, asset registry, asset
  credits, presentation-contract audit, Node syntax, local performance smoke,
  and `git diff --check` passed.

## Handoff and review

- Base: `main` at v0.12.67.
- Working branch: `feat/visual-audio-phase6-motion-spec-v0.12.68`.
- Presentation-domain QA: pass; evidence limits recorded.
- One light code-review pass completed with no actionable findings. No second
  reviewer was spawned under the task-level constraint.

## Limits and next slice

Phase 6.2 owns runtime first-month sequencing and synchronization. This slice
does not add browser animation, audio synchronization, or a first-month
resolution sequence.
